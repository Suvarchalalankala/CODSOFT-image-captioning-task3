# CODSOFT-image-captioning-task3
Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition modelslike VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.
